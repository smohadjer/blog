# Serverless Blog

This blog uses Vercel's serverless platform and reads and writes to a MongoDB instance on the cloud. Posts are read from database, injected to Handlebar template to generate HTML markup which is then sent inside response body to browser. It supports markdown and filtering using tags. No JavaScript in frontend.
